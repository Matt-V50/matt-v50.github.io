I’m a first-year PhD student at [CVISS](https://cviss.net/), advised by [Prof. Chul Min Yeum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chul-min-yeum-29b60224a/), University of Waterloo.
I got my master's degree in AI in 2024, University of Chinese Acdemic of Sciences (UCAS).
My research interest includes 3D computer vision, Gussian Splatting, Computer graphics and 3D Generative Models.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jianwei Guo](https://jianweiguo.net/) and [Prof. Xiaopeng Zhang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~zhangxiaopeng?language=en) of [NLPR Lab](https://nlpr-web.ia.ac.cn/en/) from Institute of Automation，Chinese Academy of Sciences. NLPR Lab now has been merged into [MAIS Lab](https://mais.ia.ac.cn/)

You can find my CV here: [Li Huibin’s Curriculum Vitae](../assets/cv/cv_job_20240417.pdf).

<!-- I’m actively seeking opportunities to pursue a Phd’s degree starting from Winter and Fall 2025. -->
